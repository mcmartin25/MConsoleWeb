MConsole Web is a web console that simulates MConsole console application on modern web browsers, based on HTML5 and JavaScript (with jQuery).



## How to use

This console allows you to add as a script without adding too much elements. You just need to add

```html
<div id="mconsoleweb"></div>
```

and 

```html
<!--jQuery-->
<script src="js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
<!--MConsole Web components-->
<script src="js/properties.js"></script>
<script src="js/script.js"></script>
<script src="js/execute.js"></script>
```

in the ```<body></body>``` and then you are ready to use.
